# You have found a bug!

If you found a bug&mdash;any kind, crash, unexpected behavior, typos,
etc.&mdash; we want to know about it! Please report it on the [Github
issue tracker](https://github.com/fchauvel/rasp-machine/issues).

We maintain rasp-machine on a volunteer basis, so to help make the
most our time, please include the following information:

 * The version of Python you are using. You can find it by typing
   `python --version` in terminal.
   
 * The version of RASP you are using, which shows up when you fire up
   the debugger using `rasp debug my-file.rx`
 
 * The program you are running, ideally in assembly code.
