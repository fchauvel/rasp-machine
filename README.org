#+TITLE: Random Access Stored Procedure Machine

This is a small Python3 application that implements the Random access
stored procedure machine, as designed by Cook & Reckhow in
1973 [fn:cook1973]. I developed this as a companion tool for a course
in algorithm & data structure, where it helps (I hope) to with
understanding computation models, growth orders and the applicability
of the Big-O notation.

* Overview

* Assembly Syntax

* Using RASP

* Instruction Cost Models
